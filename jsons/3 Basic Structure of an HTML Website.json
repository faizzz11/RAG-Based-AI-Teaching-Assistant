with high energy Because for this Sigma Free course, Sigma Chats like is made In today's video, I will explain the basic structure of a website Along with that, I will tell you a mobile trick With which you guys will know how you can preview your websites on your phone I have a request from you guys that you guys write in the comment section Because you know HTML or not That will help me structure this course better In this video, I will tell you the impact of ChatGPD Because a lot of things are going on about ChatGPD nowadays In the coming videos, I will also be giving you quizzes So understand this video very carefully and learn all the concepts Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro So guys, I have come inside my computer screen Now we will talk about how to open, close, and structure a website So in this folder, I will create a folder called Video3 I will click on New, then Video3 And in Video3, I will right click on Shift and open Open with Code And here you can see that my theme is blue And a lot of people have said that blue theme is not good Now, the theme is our choice If you want to change your theme, you can change your theme If you want to use GitHub Dark, you can use GitHub Dark It's your choice To create a new file, I will add index.html We have already talked about this If I write the title of the page, content, and then I use the link tag Or I can use Emmet and link style.css I am doing this so fast because we have already talked about this in the last video And if I write script.js here And here I write alert hello I will not tell you that if I add a script tag here Before body and then add script.js And then I click here and open with browser Then it will say hello And if I write the background of the body here, it will be red I will not tell you all this Because I have already told you all this I will tell you now What does this structure mean Why is it written so big This is a doubt for a beginner That we can't write the title and the content directly What is the need to write so much So I will tell you what is the need to write so much I will reload this Look, the content here is here And it's red here Now you saw that I needed to reload the page You must be wondering why I needed to reload When it already reloads live So I changed the CSS file When I change the CSS file I need to reload it at times I am using HTML file I am making changes You don't need to reload HTML file changes like this Now here What I will do is I will come back and explain to you This is a basic structure of any HTML website First of all, we write doc type HTML Then we write HTML tag Now see this is the opening tag of HTML tag This is the closing tag This is the opening tag of the body This is the closing tag This is the opening tag of the head This is the closing tag That means whatever is inside it is the content of the head Whatever is inside HTML is the content of HTML Accordingly, whatever is inside the title is the content of the title Now you will ask what is the content of meta So meta is a self-closing tag There are two types of tags in HTML One is self-closing tag And the other is pair tag What happens in pair tag is that Your opening tag is a closing tag So this is the basic structure of HTML website Now here you saw that the background is red Who is this background red? This is happening because of CSS If I remove CSS from here And ask CSS to remove it from here What will I say to CSS? Remove it from here quickly And when I ask CSS to remove it from here quickly It will have to be removed from here I will reload the page So you can see that it has been removed from here Similarly, I can also ask JavaScript Remove it from there quickly If I say from here, then the alert will also stop So if I reload now, then the alert will also stop So this CSS and JavaScript that I have added in the HTML content This was additionally used to link the functionalities of CSS and JavaScript With this HTML page Now I have already told you about the title tag This is used to set the title of the page Now it just means that you see the title up here The search engines that are there They also use this That is, the search engines like Google If you write here, then assume Code with Harry HTML So I have put all the titles of Code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working On the page You see here, HTML introduction is the title of the page So these titles of the page are used by the search engines And they are parsed Now if I change the page here Then the HTML title is working here Now I will change the page again You see here, the HTML title is installed So the titles keep changing Along with that, as I keep changing This will keep changing As you can see So the title of the HTML pages does not just mean That you see this up here These are also very useful in SEO And they also tell you what is the content of the page So they describe the content of the page As I am getting to know what is HTML execution HTML execution means How HTML is executed This is being told to me about this page So changing the title of the page is a very good SEO practice So we will make a website from any framework We will keep changing the title of the page Now here is the head section Inside the head section, there is the metadata of the page Like the title is done And which script you want to link to That is done Along with that, there are other meta tags Which I will tell you about later Meta tags basically mean How is the HTML document Keywords are added, descriptions are added Meta description is a very important keyword for SEO Meaning, what is the topic of this page That you can write here If you go to my website, you will see In the video page source That there is a meta description tag This is compressed HTML, so you don't get confused But here you can see that there is a meta description tag Which describes this page If we talk about Google, then meta description Google shows here Now I want to show you that Doc type, HTML, then what happens inside the head That the page has meta tags, title tags, script tags Link tags are also there So you can add the script tags Before and after the body And what are the differences We will talk about this in the next course But here you can see that I used the link And added the CSS again Then the body is the main content of the website Which is shown on this page So what you will see on this page That will be the body Whatever you will add inside the body You will see it here And whatever script you will add, it will execute Now by adding the script here And by adding the script in the head I will tell you this in the next course But this is a basic structure of HTML Lang is equal to EN is an attribute This is with any tag Lang is equal to EN So Lang is an attribute whose value is EN Key value pairs are used Which tell about the tag Like in meta tag, name is equal to description So name is equal to description Is an attribute And if you hover in the VS code It will tell you many things Like I hovered on the name So it is telling you about the attribute Now most of the content That is inside the body You will mostly copy the HTML raw Mostly from the website like codewithdari.com You will come here and copy the source code And if you want to talk about the forms You will come here and copy it And start making your forms And modify it So copy and paste is very important As a senior developer you should know From where to copy and paste And I am not saying this sarcastically I am not saying it sarcastically This will always be the same Now you can type it or copy and paste Obviously you will prefer to copy and paste Because this is not going to change The form will remain the same Then you have to think about innovation Which can't be copied and pasted So you can understand this as a sigma rule That you will copy and paste The thing which has to be copied and pasted And where you have to think about it It can't be copied and pasted So you will save time and think about it So this is my copyright statement But this statement is very powerful Now I will tell you about a technique Which will enable you to see This website, whatever we will develop You will be able to see in this mobile Now listen to the steps carefully Right click, open terminal And type ipconfig If you are in the old version, you can open command prompt or power shell As soon as you type ipconfig You will see ipv4 address 192.168.1.199 Now this ip address We have got this address here I will copy it And I will write in settings Live preview This local ip address To host your files on I will write my ip address And after doing this I will restart my vscode You have to ensure one more thing That you go to your wifi settings And do your network Private network It should be private network Now you can see this ip address You can see it on your phone I will put this ip address here 192.168.1.199 You can see 3000 You can also put your port And here you can see My website is previewed on mobile This trick is very useful When we want to preview on mobile Because we can see Our website is previewed on mobile And this is the most important And the most important thing We want to preview on mobile Because most of the websites are Viewed on phone So we want our phone users To enjoy our website And we are developing in computer So that testing will be done Now if you
