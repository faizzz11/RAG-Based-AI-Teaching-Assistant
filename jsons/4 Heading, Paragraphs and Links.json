about heading and paragraphs along with that, I'll also tell you about anchor text If you found this course awesome, then do like this video Your likes will help me to bring such free courses In this video, we'll make a small project which will be a bookmark website This bookmark website will help you to bring all your favorite websites together and you'll be able to use it in actual So let's start quickly, write in the comments below Sigma batch OP, let's roll the intro Intro So guys, as you can see, I'm in my computer screen and if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can do it One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com or codewithery or repository then you'll get a GitHub repo of Sigma web dev course I've made a folder of all the videos in this and the commit is also made according to the folder So do access this so that you can get the source code I'll also put the source code in the description so there's no problem Now we'll make a very basic website but it'll be very important for us because it'll be our first useful website So without taking much time I'll make a new folder in this Sigma web dev folder and I'll name it video4 because it's our 4th video So I'll make it with the name video4 by clicking on shift right and open with code So that our folder opens in the VS code After doing this, I'll do what we always do index.html, main.css, style.css and along with that script.js We usually make these 3 files If I write css, I'll put it here If I write script, I'll put it here But for now, I'll just write an exclamation mark and write in the document My bookmarks So we're going to make a bookmark website and I'll write code withery So you must have seen titles like this So I'll write h1 here Now what happens with h1? You can add headings to your web page We talked about the basic structure We said that it's an HTML page html lang is equal to en and lang is an attribute and its value is en which means that the content of this page is in English and it tells the search engines or if someone has a link of this web page then they'll know that this web page is in English and they can parse this web page accordingly The browser will also know that your web page is in English Now here we have a head which contains metadata, the title of the page the css link and all these things are information The main content is in the body Now to add headings to the body, there's a tag called h1 and I'm going to write my bookmarks So if I write my bookmarks here then we'll write it with h1 tag and if I want to live it I'll click here and then I'll open it in the browser and see how my bookmarks look like Now why should we always use h1? Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly? Because I'm telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading Now let's say I want to keep two kinds of bookmarks in my bookmarks one is the main bookmark and the other is the secondary bookmark So I'll use h2, which is the second level heading So if you use Microsoft word then you'll know what h1 and h2 are but if you don't know then I'll tell you that h1 is your main level heading and the second level heading is from h2 Let's say I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks Let's say I do something like this and here I'll press alt, shift and down arrow I'll do one thing why not turn on screencast mode So what I did here is I pressed alt, shift and down arrow and it's replicated, it's a shortcut of the BS code I want to tell you one more shortcut of the BS code that if you press alt in your keyboard and then wherever you click, there will be a cursor Let's say I click here, there'll be only one cursor but if I press alt and then click somewhere else, there'll be a cursor Let's say I want to code with every bookmark so my bookmarks dash code with every I can write something like this How did I do this? I clicked here then I pressed alt and wherever I click there I'll get multiple cursor then whatever I type will be in multiple cursor wherever there are cursor, whatever I type will be visible, isn't it? Like this thing So I'll remove it like this and then it'll be updated So this is my main heading, this is my H2 In the same way, from H1 to H2, we have H6 heading, let's say you gave a main heading after main heading, you gave a secondary heading then after that you had to give some heading inside it and so on you had to give some subheadings then you can give heading upto H6 H6 is more than enough in HTML H6 is added, you'll never need H7 in your practical life and if you do you can use H6 repeatedly because it gets smaller after H1 that H6 will become very small so you don't want it to be very small Now what I'll do here I'll replicate it with alt shift down arrow and I'll click here I'll press alt, I'm telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases Now I've added two cursor here and here, I'll press backspace and make it H3, then I'll click here I'll press alt, I'll click here and make it H4 and I'll click here I'll click here and make it H5 and I'll click here and I'll click here and make it H6, so it's upto H6 Now what I'll do is I'll write using H1 here and I'll write using here I'll press space, write using and H and here I'll click and write 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and you can see it like this so you know that H1 is like this, H2 is like this H3 is small, H4 is small, H5 is small H6 is small then what will happen, it'll be over in a while so H6 is more than enough so I'll show you a practical demonstration of this so suppose this is my HTML tutorial so here I've added the main heading, HTML introduction then I've added what is HTML then features of HTML I've added this from H1, this from H2 then if something comes in H2 then I've added this from H3 then if something comes in H2, then I've added this from H3 like here, why the term hypertext and markup language is heading 2, what's the main heading page then HTML introduction then this is the heading I wanted to give a quick exercise in this too so I've added H3 in it then it came back to H2 so in building the hierarchy H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used I hope you've understood many people are commenting that you're starting very slow so I'm making this course as a beginner course when I tell you about HTML then you'll say that it's very easy then you'll say yes, this is also easy then you'll say JavaScript then you'll say Bootstrap then you'll say yes, this is also easy then you'll say React then you'll say what's happening then say Node.js then I'll take things to MongoDB MySQL then once the level goes up I've said we'll raise the bar like anything, this is what I meant so when we'll do React when we'll make projects there then I'll ask them for comments like tell me what's the level so don't talk about the level it's going to raise so these are our headings 6 headings that I want to keep now if we want to write paragraphs then we can use P tag we'll hit enter and it'll come up now I'll tell you a shortcut trick if you want to write a dummy paragraph then what will you do you'll write here Lorem suppose I wrote Lorem23 then it'll give me 23 words something like this you can do a word wrap on Vue then you won't get horizontal scroll bar so do this Vue word wrap now here you'll see Lorem Epsom dollarsit this is a dummy text why do we want dummy text sometimes because we're making templates and we have to fill that template for example you're making a website which looks like OYO rooms now here OYO become a member I don't want to write all this I just wrote Lorem now here I want to write something so I'll write Lorem7 then I'll give it to OYO they'll do what they want so here you can use it to fill placeholder my plan is we'll make clones of popular websites so that you know how things work this is also a popular website if you've used their services then do let me know in the comment section now we'll see other things here you'll see paragraphs how to style it and all these are done through CSS now in paragraphs when I wrote Lorem23 I'll type P enter if I type Lorem10 then only 10 words will come and if I want to write Lorem100 then I can do that so this Lorem trick is very good you'll enjoy it and whenever we make clones of popular websites let's say I make a clone of Amazon.in so here I want to write something I can't see many texts let's say I want to write 3 words so I'll write Lorem3 I won't think about makeup products I'll write Lorem4 or Lorem3 or Lorem2 and I'll make a template and then whatever comes from my database I can bring it in different ways many people asked will this course be job ready the answer is yes I'll make you learn about industry level jobs through this course now let's talk about attributes in HTML these are the attributes like I used HTML tag lang is equal to en we didn't use any attribute in body we didn't use any attribute in h1 we didn't use any attribute in P but I can use a style attribute in P which is called inline CSS if I make background color red like this then its background color will be red this is also called inline CSS through style attribute style is equal to if you add CSS here then you'll get background red here you can see this is background red I'll use teal this color looks good I can also add style inline but when you make industry level websites we use inline styles very less because maintainability and reusability is less so we want to shift a small bundle on the browser and our website is more optimized so we avoid all these things but inline CSS style is a tag but here style is an attribute P is a tag P tag has an attribute style through which we can style this element we'll talk about many more attributes attributes basically give an element enhanced functionality like we gave a style to this paragraph which was background color we used style attribute to give this background color similarly to give properties we use this type of attribute tag or element like we talked about link colon CSS link has relic attribute href attribute so with this attribute we can use this CSS style sheet like background color I'll say body first what we need in body background color and don't worry about this because in CSS it'll be explained but I'll tell you I'll do hotpink another functionality of VS code this ninja technique will be useful hover mouse and choose any color you want I'll leave it and do like this so this is my background color so write ninja technique in comments it looks good now we are back in index.html I can remove this I'll comment it so style sheet won't be there which is very natural background color was coming from style sheet this background color was coming from inline CSS so we didn't remove it which is very natural here I did style=\"backgroundcolorthistle so its background color was visible now we'll make a bookmark bookmark manager bookmark manager.html I'm making this file because I've told you different headings I'm going to make a useful bookmark manager so I'll write bookmark manager now you'll say this bookmark manager is in chrome why are you making it? because it's made by us so you'll have a different love for it because this you made it yourself so you made one software so the software you made is different now you can see bookmark manager code with area I'll write h1 and my bookmarks now I'll write h2 here primary bookmarks and then secondary bookmarks in fact if I space all shift bottom and write secondary bookmarks then what will happen? now I'll write google or I'll write google like this we'll write it from list but in upcoming videos I'll tell you how to use list for now you can think like this google, suppose I write google open google and I'll use anchor tag so as I enter A A has a mandatory attribute href href means click and go to which link so href is equal to www.google.com so it'll go to this address whenever someone clicks open google and I'll cut this open google and put it here so the content of the stack will be like this and here you can see a href is equal to ea and open google this is called anchor tag which helps us to make links you must have seen many links like this now you can see here as soon as I go to bookmark manager.html you can see here you can see all the bookmarks now I'll click on this you can see when I didn't click on this it was blue and when I visited it it changed color so it's converted to visited so I know that I've visited it now I'll tell you one more thing if we want it to open in new tab like I'm clicking on this it's opening in the same tab if you want to open it in new tab you have two ways you can click on this this mouse wheel now I'll tell you another way if you want it to open in new tab you can use an attribute you can write here target is equal to underscore blank and we get suggestions from vscode so I've written it by hitting two enter if you write it in notepad or any other cheap editor so what happens to you it's cheap according to quality if you use cheap editor so target is equal to underscore blank you have to type it completely but if you write it in any way and what will happen I'm not clicking on mouse wheel I'll click on it mouse wheel will open in new tab so I can open it like this I've written it in simple open google if you want you can use your favorite website you can use it friends, I've used good websites now I'll write open facebook and here you can see www.facebook.com and I'll write kora.com and codewithery.com and after this let's say youtube.com let's see if it's coming or not if you see one thing it's coming in one line if you want it to not come in one line so what you'll do you'll put it in your paragraphs it's a very dirty way but you can put it in a paragraph if you want I'll press shift, right arrow I'll press control x and then I'll press end all the cursor will go to end because if you press end on one cursor it goes to end and I'll press control v I've used this shortcut a lot and some of you will be like what did I do I simply used the vscode I've used multiple cursor this is not a good way we never make a list we use lists but because we haven't read the list we're using paragraphs but this will do our job and the ones we haven't visited are blue we've visited facebook, it's color is also purple we've visited kora, it's color is also purple so these are your primary bookmarks what will be your secondary bookmarks we'll put 2 secondary bookmarks your secondary bookmarks are those that you visit sometimes and let's say stackoverflow.com we'll write the spelling correctly stackoverflow let's capitalise on stackoverflow and now you see your wikipedia and stackoverflow are in your secondary bookmarks so this is your bookmark manager and you can make it better we'll learn CSS styling later so if you think it's ugly don't worry about it because we'll do styling in the future we'll talk about it so this is your bookmark bookmark manager code with hr is your title and I'll write it in h1 so both our titles will be same so our title will be same and my bookmarks code with hr will be same so this is how you can make a bookmark manager you can use it in actual if you save it like this like this bookmark manager.html you can copy it and put it on your desktop then whenever you want to open a website you just double click it if you double click it and it opens from the VS code then you'll have to open with it choose another app and then choose google chrome and always do it so whenever I double click it it'll open from google chrome so this was our bookmark manager I hope you liked it I have a request from you today we completed 4 videos so if you liked the code I want you to share it with your friends I'll try to bring more such courses I'll try to bring more such courses I'll try to bring more such courses many people are shocked and saying how this course is free and I'll find some other ways to make more money but the thing is I'm going to mark this course as the best course of web development I'll put everything in it and I'll teach you in the least many ad techs got angry with me many companies told me to launch this paid course on our platform many companies got angry with me and told me to launch this as paid course why are you doing this, you'll regret your decision but hopefully I won't regret my decision to make this course free I'll earn money from other ways and I'll teach you in this course how you can earn more money through web development with that said, I'll put the source code in the description or you can take it from this repository that's it for today thank you so much for watching this video till we meet again"}
