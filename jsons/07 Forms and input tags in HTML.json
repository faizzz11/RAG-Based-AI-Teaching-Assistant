    "text": " In this video, we will know what are the forms and what is the input tag in the form Using the form is an important element of websites because you submit data from client to server through the form These are the forms which you see on contact pages, google forms or enquiry forms The date and time on the flight or railway ticket, where to go and where to go, all these details are submitted through the HTML forms In the last video, very few people liked it I will request you to like this video with high energy So that we can maintain high energy throughout the course So let's go to the computer screen and see the forms, input tags and some best practices Let's roll the intro So guys, I have come to my computer screen And now see I am going to make a folder here quickly I am going to name this video video6 Because this is the 6th video, I will click on shift right and open with code I have already told you all about this And here I am going to make index.html And by putting an exclamation mark in it I will do a view word wrap, turn on the screen cast mode And you see here I will write forms Let's learn it So I have set the title of this forms page And what happens by setting the title? The title will be shown on our page Here I want to tell you about a very important setting Show preview Some of you have pointed out in the comments that You have to click so many times, can you do it? Yes you can, click on gear and then on settings And after clicking on settings You can simply write live preview And we can actually set it Such that whenever we click on it It will open on the external browser So now I will close everything And as soon as I click on it It will open on the external browser And I will come to my browser And the sigma web development codes playlist You can access it on the new clicker's star And here on the bookmark But now I want to tell you As soon as we click here You will see it has opened So if you want it to be like this But sometimes you will want to prefer side by side view And when you want to do that When you are actually using HTML, CSS And working on design So whenever you are working on design You definitely want to see live previews So that's why this extension was made And it was made different from live server So that you can see previews on the side Now what we will do here We will learn about forms What is a form? You know the name form It's a railway form We fill it and our reservation is done Along with that we fill the form of IIT JEE We fill the form of NEET We fill the form of any exam So that our data can reach those who want it So this is a form HTML is a form tag So you will enter the form And it will ask you the first question What is the action of your form Get or Post Let me tell you a quick difference Between Get request and Post request We will see this later When we will read the back end Get request is a very simple request And we send the post request In most of the cases When we have to give a lot of data For example, whenever our form is posted We will use the post request in most of the cases And what is a get request It's a very simple request That we just have to tell the server And that's it Or we have to hit the server with a request That's it But if you still don't understand this That should be fine No problem Because we will do this in detail later So form action is equal to post I have written it here Now I can show you some input tags I will tell you what are the input tags What will be the elements in your form Like you can enter date You can enter the form You can tell the name You can tell the phone number You can tell the age It can be just a number You can put these things in the form So I want to tell you That the input tag You put it in the form And there is a label tag Which is used to label the input So what I will do here The simplest input tag is type is equal to text So I will put the type is equal to text input here And if I zoom out And if I zoom out So here is the input type is equal to text Name is equal to username Placeholder is enter and username Actually it will look like this You can enter your username And the user you are going to enter You have to enter the username I will write an actual And I will write here For example form to apply For sigma web dev ta For sigma web dev ta sigma web development codes ta sigma web development codes ta Suppose we are hiring teaching assistants For sigma web development codes So we can write something like this By the way I have added subtitles If you haven't access the playlist Then do access it And along with that I will show you one more thing So these subtitles are very funny So write sigma batch op and your village land And give your village land So if someone is watching this Or someone who doesn't know Hindi He will say that what happened till here And give your village land to me So you can see here I have put the H1 here Which is our main heading Along with input tag we use label tag Now whose label is this So for is equal to I will write its id For example I will write its id username And for is equal to I will put its id Now what is this id I will tell you this later For now just understand that This is a unique identifier To identify this element Like your Aadhar number is not of anyone else In the same way this id username Is not available to anyone else I will tell you more in detail later So I have written label for is equal to username And you can see here That the label will come So I have not put anything in the label So I will enter Your username And you can see here You will get to see Enter your username And you can enter your expertise Anything Suppose I have to ask what is your gender So I can do something like this And you can see enter your gender And as soon as I do this I can ask you what is this Now what happens here We can wrap this in div Div is our block element And what are inline and block elements I have not told you in this course But I will tell you in the upcoming videos So for now just understand That I am putting this in div to give a new space So as soon as I put this in div It will come in new space Yes there is a br tag But I don't prefer br tag And you will get to know why We don't want to bloat our HTML with br tag You will get to know this in upcoming videos Now you can see here Enter your username Now as soon as I am clicking on female This radio button is selected Why is this happening Because the label I have put for is equal to female And here I have put ID female And along with that Here I have put name is equal to gender In this input tag And name is equal to gender is also in input radio tag And as soon as we have type is equal to radio It means this is radio button And if we have same name Then only one of these can be selected If I select this then it will be this If I select this then it will be this Now I will show you one thing If I make the ID in the label form wrong And here also in the form If I make the ID wrong in the first one Then when I click on the female Then I will see that it is not selected I am clicking on male and it is selected So to select female I have to click here So what I have to do I have to put the ID of for is equal to The input tag So you can see here I have put label for is equal to female Along with that we have an input tag Which is type is equal to checkbox Now see here if I put Type is equal to checkbox I will put this in div And I will do the same as format document This will be very good I mean its formatting and indents Now see here Subscribe to newsletter Here I can check it And the difference between radio button and checkbox Is that you can check the checkbox Here if you want to select Male or female or any option Then you can select it like this After this we have text area And select tag And I will show you that So this is text area and select tag And copy the text area And I will show you the text area So text area input type is equal to Text but it has rows and column attribute Which helps you to make the size smaller Now see here The placeholder inside this Is enter your comment here So I have entered the text here Ideally we will keep it empty Or we will not give it a new line So I will paste it here And now it will reach the left side So it has reached the left side So enter your comment here And any user can put their comment here Now see I have put the text area Content here So you don't want to do this You want to keep the text area empty And you want to put a label And you can say label for is equal to comment And definitely we will put the ID here Whenever we put for It is inside for And the element for which it is there is the ID Now see here If I write enter your comment What will happen? If I write enter your comment It will come here Now you will say this is not the style So this is not the style Because we will style it with CSS later For now I will just put the br tag But I don't recommend br tag I am telling you again I don't recommend br tag Because br tag causes problems You should know that br tag is a line break tag So you might be thinking That what is the problem with br tag But I will tell you I don't recommend it I don't recommend using it all the time I mean people think that They should put br tag and add new spaces I oppose this So I will copy it And show you the select tag And you see here As I put the select tag here I put it inside div So in select you get some options The syntax of select is like this Apple, banana, cherry You can use any of them And here I have values equal to apple First I made a select tag And gave name equal to fruits Then option value is equal to apple Option value is equal to banana Option value is equal to cherry When we will parse this form data I will tell you in the javascript part How to send this data to the server So there are many things about form Which I will tell you So stay tuned for that So this was about forms I wanted to tell you about the elements of forms So I have shown you the elements of forms In this video And I have also shown you the select tags And other things About the forms I have told you about the action You can submit the form on any page And where it will handle So you can give that data here Then there is method of get request or post request I will tell you the difference in these videos But I have told you in a very rough way That get request is a very simple request Post request is used when sending big data So you can send a lot of data in this We don't even send passwords in get request We send it with post request So here I have told you the method What happens in the name Name is equal to username means We mark it with name So the server will know What is the key corresponding value So the key value pair will go to the server According to the name So we will see this when we will do server side processing What is the meaning of placeholder What will be written inside this So here enter your username is placeholder If I click on this So this enter username is not written in this I will write anything But enter username is telling me That I have to put username in this Then required means You have to require it You have to put value of it Otherwise your form won't be submitted So we will use this a lot Then we have autofocus Autofocus automatically focuses on cursor So I will show you the magic of autofocus So here you have written autofocus in the input tag So I have written autofocus in the username Now I will reload it So if I type on it Autofocus will automatically focus on it So by doing autofocus You will type whatever you want I hope you are understanding these things Now validation attribute Required I have told you You can give pattern In which you can give regular expression Now you people don't get confused I don't know the expression of pattern So I will teach you everything But you have to understand That we will accept a particular pattern If we put pattern is equal to this Then you can't put anything apart from this So you should know this So I hope you are enjoying this video And along with that Please write sigma batch op in the comment section And in the first video Please review this course Because still many people ask me Should I do this course or not Because this is a free course So people don't value it So should I watch this course or take paid course And I would like to give a note To those people who asked me To take paid course Should I collect the money Or should I join sigma batch You should join sigma batch Because I don't think I need to tell you the quality of this course So you should join this course You will get everything I am telling you I am telling you I was going to sell this course for 10,000 Yes that was the amount I was going to sell this course for 10,000 And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course If anyone is selling There is nothing wrong in selling any course But the thing is If you have bought any other course And you still feel that sigma is a great course Then you should join Because if you make a career You won't need any of these things If you will look back in the future You will also say Yes we took a paid course And then we took a free course And if you make a career Then all these things won't matter in the future So do what is right for you And do your work I hope you are understanding things So like the video Access the playlist Subscribe to the channel And in the comment section Write sigma batch op That's it for this video And I will see you next time"
