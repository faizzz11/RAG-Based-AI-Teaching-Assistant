The concept of ID and classes is one of the most confusing concepts. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was very confused in ID and classes. ID means unique identifier. If you give an ID to an element, then you will not give that ID to the other element. But class means that if you want to give multiple elements, then you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class named red to a div and a form. Similarly, you can give a class named BG red to an article tag and a header tag. Please like this video because we will now go to the computer screen and see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Let's go. Music Alright guys, I am back. If you haven't accessed the sigma web development codes, then you can access the playlist by clicking on the bookmark. Click on save and the source code is also being uploaded on github. Now I will come to the folder and create a folder named video9. I will create a video9 folder here. I will write video9 and after creating a video9 folder, I will right click on shift and open with code. And you can see that it has opened in BS code. I will write index.html here and I will enter using exclamation mark. And along with that, I will tell you what ID and classes are. Do you have an Aadhar card? If you don't have, then you must have some ID. Now don't write in the comments that you don't have ID. Whenever you go somewhere, you have to show your ID to prove your identity. That I am this. Now if you want to understand ID and classes in HTML, then ID is your identity. What is that? It is your identity. So listen to a story here. This is John and this is Harry. They are very good friends. They don't share their lunch and they are very good friends. They don't share their lunch and they are very good friends. And you can see that John and Harry have their Aadhar card ID. So this is my Aadhar number and John's Aadhar number looks like this. So this is John's Aadhar number and this is my Aadhar number. Our Aadhar numbers can never be the same. Or suppose we have a friend, Tanya and John's friend, Shruti. So their Aadhar numbers will be different. And this is Tanya's Aadhar number. Now this Aadhar number will be different for everyone. So John and Harry were friends, John's friend, Shruti, Tanya's Aadhar number. None of these four numbers are the same. So if I tell you any of these Aadhar numbers, you will understand that it is Harry. And if I tell you 54, 56, 57, you will understand that it is Shruti. And if I tell you 54, 56, 58, 68, 63, you will understand that it is Tanya. So this Aadhar number uniquely identifies Tanya, Harry, Shruti and John. So this is their Aadhar number, their Aadhar ID. This Aadhar number will not be found by anyone else. And also, suppose John and Harry spent their childhood together, they were in the same class and the name of that class was Class 10. Suppose they are in the 10th class. Suppose, it is said to be. And suppose Shruti is in the 9th class. And Tanya is in the 9th class. So both the classes are in the 9th class. Tanya and Shruti are in the 9th class. So what is Shruti's class? Tanya's class can also be in the 9th class. Shruti will not be alone in this class. Or Harry will not be alone in the 10th class. There are other kids in the class. So the meaning of class is that Harry and John are in one class. So can a class be a multiple of one person? A class can be a multiple of one person. Suppose Harry is in the 10th class. And he goes to a tuition where this class is in the 10th class. Suppose there are classes in that tuition. So there can be more than one class. One is in the 10th class and the other is in the 10th class. And along with that, suppose Harry wears a red t-shirt, so his class is also in the red class. So class doesn't mean that he is in the class. It means that he is classified in this class. Now come here, leave John and Harry Shruti. I'll delete this. I'll zoom out and delete it. Now come to index.html and understand this. Suppose I made a div and I gave it a class, red. And I made a span and I gave it a class, red. Can I give different classes to different elements or the same class? Yes, I can. But if I want to put an ID in any element, suppose I put an ID in its first div, I can put anything in the ID. So I can't give this ID to any other element because it is its Aadhar card. Even if it's a second div, I can't put it. So I'll have to put something else in the ID. I put the second div. And I'll write second and first here. So this is the concept of ID and classes. I understood this concept very late. I used to learn Webflow and in my early days. Nobody told me that ID unites an element. And the class can put multiple classes in one element and one class in multiple elements. Do you understand? For example, if I gave it a red class, I can also give it a BGLO class. BGLO. I can give it only one class. And if we give multiple classes to any element, we can put a space. For example, if I want multiple classes to be put in this element, what will I do? First, I'll write red here. Then I'll put a space and write BGLO. So I can give multiple classes to the same element. Can I give multiple IDs to the same element? Have you ever heard of Aadhar cards? I don't know about the ones made by others. But there are no Aadhar cards. Aadhar numbers are one of one person. And Aadhar numbers cannot be the same of different people. One person cannot have multiple. Different people cannot have the same. But the class, if I ask you which color of T-shirt you wear, or if you can wear a red T-shirt, no problem, you'll get it if you go on the road. And let us say, you like mango, or you like banana, or you like grapes, you'll get multiple people. So let's say, they are in banana class, or they are in grapes class, or in mango class. So we can classify in one class, and we can give different elements to one class. So I hope you understood this. Now I'll write some CSS here. Don't say that I'm not reading CSS. What I'm writing in CSS is, I'm writing some alien language. In style.css. I'll click here. And you can see the preview here. First and second. I'll show you one thing. First, how do we target class in CSS? By adding dots. Dot rate means red class. And hash first div means, hash means ID, dot means class. If I say, the first div, make it background color red. So if you make the background color red, it will turn red. These are the selectors in CSS. I don't want to confuse you. And I can comment in CSS. But we'll see all these things later. Now by adding dot rate, I'll write background color red. And what I'll do with dot bglo? I'll add dot bglo. I have to add dot. Dot means class. Class bglo. And I'll make background color yellow. Sorry, I'll make it color red. Not background color red. Dot rate means color red. So you can use ID and classes in CSS. I hope you understood this. Now one thing to note here is that ID and classes are attributes of an element. This is ID attribute and this is class attribute. So what are ID classes? Are they elements? No. They are attributes of elements. Now there is one more use of ID. I'll tell you what is the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write coding, then Wikipedia has this page. Let's say I go to a bigger page. So when you go to any page on Wikipedia, then what you can do is you can take the link of that particular page. Let me show you how it works. Let's go to another page. I'll scroll down. And here I'll inspect and see its ID. So I'll copy its ID. And if I add hashtag and this ID, if I enter it, it'll bring me directly to ICDA 8. So if I put it in incognito, it'll scroll down and show me that particular ID. Instead of showing me this, it'll scroll down and show me because it wants to bring me to this ID. So it works in linking too. Remember this too. Very few people will tell you that you can generate links too. If you write ID by using hashtag, then when you open that link, it'll focus on that ID. As you can see, as I'm entering, I might have made a mistake. But you got the point. 29.29 and if I hit enter, it'll scroll down. If I open incognito or reload it, it'll scroll down. And if I open a new tab, and if I do this, it'll bring me to the same page where this ID is. I hope you understood the idea and classes through this video. ID is like Aadhaar Card. Like which class he likes. One element can be given multiple classes. One can be red, and the background can be yellow. And the other can be red and background can be yellow. So red class can be given multiple classes. You can put red class in one element and also red class in one element. And also BG yellow class. So I hope you understood. So that's it for this video. I was reading captions and I laughed. I told them to name me and I laughed 5-10 times. I told them to name me and I said name your village and my name. So that's it for this video.
