So, like the video. I know very few people like videos on YouTube. But if you do, thanks to your support, I get the motivation to bring such free courses. So, let's go to the computer screen and start the 5th video of the Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I'm here on my computer screen as you can see. First of all, I'd like to tell you to bookmark getup.com slash code with Harry. In fact, bookmark this repository so that you can get all the code. Secondly, click on the playlist and bookmark it. Click on start and click on save. Now, the first thing I'll tell you about is about images. What is image in HTML? So, what we'll do is we'll quickly create a folder called video5. So, here's the new folder and here's video5. You'll know this by clicking on shift right and then open with code. I'll be very quick this time because I've already told you this. But if you want to not see this welcome page again and again, then uncheck show welcome page on startup and you won't see this again and again. But what we're doing is we'll create index.html, we'll make some control, we'll zoom in with mouse wheel, we'll toggle the screencast mode so that you'll know when and why I'm pressing a button. Now, I'll put an exclamation mark and bring the emitter abbreviation here. And I'll put a view word wrap here. You can see here that the word wrap is now closed. So, here the horizontal scroll bar won't appear. Now, what I'll do is I'll write images here. First of all, I'll write images here. And I'll simply bring an image here. Now, you can bring an image from the internet. I'll write here, let's say we want to bring an image of a train. Okay, train images. Because we've run a lot of trains in the course. So, why will we bring train images? I'll save images and here in sigma web development course, in the folder number 5, there's a CMS file. In fact, I'll do one thing, I'll cancel it. I'll take its SNP because it's a CMS extension. I'll put it in PNG. So, I've pressed Windows, Shift and S. It's a shortcut to snipping tool. If you don't know, then now you'll know through sigma web development course that if you press Windows, Shift and S, your snipping tool opens up in Windows. If you don't know, then tell me honestly in the comment section. Now, what we'll do is I've done Windows, Shift and S. I got into the conversation. So, you click here and save it. Here, the floppy disk option of save is here. You click here and go to downloads, go to sigma web development course and save it in video 5. Okay, I've saved it in the name of image. Now, in HTML, there's an IMG tag. IMG, as soon as you put it, SRC and alt are its required attributes. In fact, you can also not write alt, but it's recommended. I'll tell you what happens with these two attributes. First of all, if you write in SRC, image.png, you can see this image is here, so this is image.png. And I'll put train image in alt. Now, if I show you this in the browser preview, then look, it looks like this. This is our page and this is the train image. What happened by doing this? Where did the alt go? You can say, I'll tell you where it went. Where did it go? We put it in alt. So, we didn't show the thing we put in alt. Let's say for some reason, the server can't show you the image. Then what will happen? Suppose I wrote image2 by mistake. Now, there's no file named image2.png here. So, what will be the error? What will happen? I'll show you what will happen. So, here alt will be displayed and this kind of an error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that the image you have put, put it properly, you have done something wrong. Here, the server URL you have given, there is no image there. So, this is how things are displayed. And there alt is displayed. So, the user gets to know what is the purpose of this image. And if I come back here, you can put alt in the image. If I don't put alt, then what will happen? If I don't put alt, then the alt text won't come. So, you don't want the user to see this image when your server is error. You want this scenario to be made. The user should see this train image. I hope you understood this. So, the image is very straightforward. There are two more attributes which are very important. One is width. Which is width in pixels. If I write 23, width is equal to, you can see. In fact, I will fix the image first. I wrote image2 by mistake. Image.png is here. So, you can see here I have taken 23 pixels. Which is very small. So, I will make it 230 pixels. You don't need to write px in this. When we write width in CSS, we will see that we need to write px. Or we just write width is equal to double quotes in the number. As you can see. Okay. If I bring it here, you can see that we have seen this small image. If I give it height, I will give it height. I will say that if I keep its height 230, then its aspect ratio will be decreased. So, it will be stretched a little. Because it has made its width 230 and its height 230. As you can see. Now, if you want its height to be 230 and its width to be automatically adjusted. Then you just use height attribute. Now, remove the width one. So, its height will be 230 pixels. And it will automatically adjust as much as it can. Now, look. It is automatically adjusted in width. And it took it in height. Now, what happens is that width and height can be adjusted through CSS. And we will see in the CSS section that why we should always set this width and height. We should always set the width and height from one thing. Such that when our page is loading, then the image inside our page will not come to the page. I will tell you in the coming videos. But now you understand that these width and height attributes. I have heard many people saying that it has been deprecated and should not be used. But I say that it should be used for SEO purposes. Why should it be used? I will tell you in the coming videos where I will tell you about core web vitals and SEO. For now, you understand that width gives the image. Height gives the image. If one of them is set, then the other one is automatically set. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write PX or pixel. You just have to write this number. And that's it. This is an attribute, height. And there is an SRC attribute and an alt attribute. You can also use style attribute in this. In fact, you can use style attribute with almost all tags. So this was about the image. Now we will talk about tables in HTML. Table tags are very useful in HTML. I will tell you what table tags are. You get to see a table from table tags. Now I will copy this table from here. And when I copy this table from here, you will see that my page will look like this. So this is the table of HTML. Where is my preview page? Here it is. Here you can see the name, HarryAge100. Now if I add more things here. Let's say I add something like this. Let's say I add name. And here I add, let's say, designation. Let's say I add Harry's designation. I add programmer. And let's say I want to add more things. I will use alt shift bottom arrow key. And here let's say I want to write favorite language. And I want to write JavaScript. And now you see that this table will look like this. Name, destination, favorite language. So what is this? How does it work? I will tell you. So here you see that we have used table tags. Table tags have tr tags. Which is table row. What will come in this row? You will get to see this. Now if you want to use this as table heading. You say that this is my table row. Which means this is my row. In which name, destination and your favorite language are written. What will come in this row? And what will come? Here you can see that it will be a heading. So I will use th. Th means table heading. And we will write that only once. So in the first tr, we will write th. Once we put the heading on top, then we will put the data. So we will put td in table row. Which stands for table data. And here you will add these rows in the tr. What will happen? Your rows will be added. So here let's say I write sam. And this is also a programmer. And let's say this is Java, its favorite language. So these rows will be added below the table. You can see that these rows are added, are added, are added. We will see from css how it can be bordered. It can be styled. But it looks like this default. And yes I know it is ugly. But you just understand that the table works like this. Now there are row span and call span attributes. Now you see here that row span means how many rows will be spanned by your td. For example, let's say I write here. I want sam and programmer. Earlier they were taking one cell. Sam was taking one cell. Programmer was taking one cell. I want to write sam in two cells. So I don't want to write programmer. I just want to write sam. And I want to write here that call span is equal to 2. So call span is equal to 2 means that sam will now take the place of two columns. What does it mean? Sam will now take the place of two columns. That means sam will look like this. I'll show you. Like this. So it took the place of the whole column. So the call span means how many columns will be surrounded. By default, only one cell will be surrounded. But sometimes one cell will be surrounded by two columns. To demonstrate this, I'll explain it to you in Excel. In Excel, you can think of it as a table of our HTML. Sometimes I want two columns to be spanned by one data. So here we use merge cell. And here let's say I write sam. In HTML, this is done by using call span. Sometimes we want to merge vertically. Let's say I want to merge these two cells. There we use row span. And with whom we'll use row span? We'll use row span with td obviously. So with td, we'll use call span and row span. So if we use row span, it'll span like this. So I hope you understood this. And when we make tables and projects of HTML, you'll understand it better. But I'll show you the row span quickly. So if I write row span is equal to 2, and then I write another tr here, then you'll see that my table is looking like this. Now to better explain this, I'll put a CSS style here. What I'll do here is add a style sheet. I'll add a style sheet and name it style.css. So in style.css, and you don't need to understand CSS. I'll tell you already. I'll write border in td. 2px solid black. And I'll tell you how it works. But for now, you'll understand that I've put this to explain it to you. So I said that this row will have Harry, programmer and JavaScript. Then I said that this sam, how much will be its row span? I gave 2 rowspan. So my Java will have 2 rowspan. So how many rows will Java take? Obviously 2. So Java will take 2 rows. So you can see that Java took 2 rows. So when Java took 2 rows, it means I don't have to write Java in the next one. Because it's already been surrounded. So I won't write Java in the next one. So I'll write Java here. I gave 2 rowspan for this. So what happened by doing this? You can see that it was Harry, programmer and JavaScript. So it's row span will be 2. So it will take 2 columns. This sam will take 2 columns. And this Java will take 2 rows. So you can see that it's exactly the same. It took 2 rows and 2 columns. So this is how you can use row span and call span in HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use this type of caption. So I'll show you that if we use caption in table, student details or employee details, then your page will look like this. You can see that employee details will be added here. Now CSS can also be changed to its font size. But for now, by default, it looks like this. You can also add header and footer. You can add Thead and Tfoot here. For example, if I add some content in Thead and Tfoot, like this. If I add header and footer here, then you can see Thead and Tfoot like this. You can see header and footer here. Now I'll tell you about another tag which is called brtag which adds line break. So after the image, line break will appear. So this is header. And after this, I'll add footer below. I won't add it here. So I'll add it after the table. So this is my table footer. Now I can change it to CSS. Now I can group my header and footer content from Thead and Tfoot like this. So what will be the header of my table? I can group the content which I have written here. I can add it in Thead. Along with that, the content which will be in the table will be in Tbody. So what will be in Tbody? My table content will be like this. And after this, if I write Tfoot here and I want to add some data at the end, I'll add another TR. As you can see, I'll right click it and document the format. So it will be a better format. Now I want to group my content in Tfoot. So this is just a way to group. I've added it in Tfoot. I've added some TR in Tbody which is my main body. And I've added it in Thead which is my table header. And obviously, there won't be any change. I've only grouped it. I'll write footer here so that you can see that it is footer. I'll write foot here. And you can see that our last row is foot. Now what's the benefit of doing this? We've only grouped it so that we can target So you won't use this much. But you can do grouping like this. Your whole table will have head content and foot content here. And body content comes in between head and foot. But you can write it here. But ideally, head, body and then foot. I hope you understood this. So that's all about HTML tables. You don't need to know more than this. And now we'll talk about list. List is very important in HTML because we'll use list a lot. There are 3 types of list in HTML. One is ordered list, one is unordered list and one is definition list. Unordered and ordered list are the most used. Let's see unordered list first. Whenever we want to have unordered data like I'll write here UL. So I'll write here as UL means unordered list. I can write li in it. And I can write Harry. And then I can write Rohan. And then I can write Shubham. So when I write Harry, Rohan and Shubham then when I write UL it will come like this. This is unordered list. Look, Harry, Rohan and Shubham are here. They don't have any order. But if I want it to be ordered then I can write this with the help of OL. So if I make its opening closing tag OL and keep the other things the same then it will be ordered list. So here it will have 1, 2, 3. You can do ABC with this 1, 2, 3. You can do capital ABC. You can do it with the help of CSS. You can do it with other ways. You can see here that if I write li in UL, it will come like this. You can see in this image that if I write li in OL, it will come like this. This is the example of ordered list. And this is the example of definition list. Definition list is rarely used. It is previewed like this. First I have added heading and then I have written dl. dl means definition list. Then dt and then dd. Then definition term and definition of definition. So it comes like this. You can change CSS as well. It is rarely used. But you should know about it for interviews. If you ask about definition list then it is previewed like this. I am not showing it for the sake of time. But try it out. Here we will see the unordered list. I have told you about unordered list. It is very simple and straightforward. You can customize its bullet points by using this. For example, if I write type is equal to square I can write type is equal to and suppose I write square So I have written type is equal to square in the unordered list. So it appears like a square. Similarly, I can circle its type in the unordered list. I can square it and I can disc it. Disc by default means bullet is visible by default. I can square it and I can circle it. Along with that you can add many other list items in the list items. Now let's see the unordered list in unordered list if you write li then it will appear like this 1,2,3 but you can use type is equal to i, when you use type is equal to i you will get upper case roman numbers type is equal to small i then lower case roman numbers type is equal to 1 which is default you don't need to do this small a will give you alphabetical and capital a will give you upper case alphabetical let's see the unordered list type is equal to I will use capital a VS code is giving us examples and suggestions and it is easier for us to see its possible values so VS code is very useful and many people are using old editors which were used before if you know their plugins and you are set to VS code then switch to VS code all the big developers use VS code if you want to use coding in mobile then I will comment on this app called replete and I would like to give a shout out to replete.com because I use it a lot so you can use replete.com in your mobile as well if you don't have a computer then you can use it I will cover it in upcoming videos but I will stick to VS code I hope you understood ordered list, unordered list, definition list now we have completed 5 videos in sigma map development series so let me know how you are feeling I got 5 stars according to the initial review I know that I am late in ordering but I know that people who are doing this kind of things don't comment much on youtube but still I want you to comment tell me how is the course going and keep writing sigma batch op it gives a lot of motivation this way we will have a two way interaction I will feel good if you keep commenting I will give the source code in the description please access it please like the video comment sigma batch op and name your village thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time bye"}
