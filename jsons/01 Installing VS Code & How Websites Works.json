full-stack developer In the future, you will be given many projects During the course and at the end of the course, we will make some good projects So that your hold on web development becomes very strong According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn That's why I will make you a lot of projects And if you agree, then write in the comment section below I agree Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face So do comment I want to make you believe that after completing this course You can make any kind of website from start to end And during this course, I will make you make a lot of websites So that your confidence will go up a lot So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course Let's roll the intro Alright guys, so I have come to my computer stream And now, as I am doing, you guys follow me as I am doing I have downloaded Google Chrome browser You also download Google Chrome browser I am not saying that it won't work But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner Which I am doing here So here we will follow exactly as I am doing And along with that, you guys will be able to follow the videos exactly I will quickly go to Google And I will write down download vs code Now what is this vs code This is a source code editor If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system Then you can download this for that operating system And the process will be exactly the same as you can see That in my downloads folder Here we have the vs code And as you can see here As the setup has been downloaded I will refresh it And here you can see the vs code setup I can double click on it and install it So simply, it is as easy as installing vs code Or installing a game You can quickly read the agreement here This lies in upslice to the damages And after that, I will accept the agreement You guys also read it like me And I am the fastest reader in the world Next, next It is important to check both the icons It is very important to check both the icons If you want a desktop shortcut If you want to get a shortcut in the desktop Click on the Create a desktop icon And then click on next And then click on install If your PC is as fast as mine, then it will be as fast as mine But if your PC is a bit slow Then there is no problem It will be a bit slow install Nothing more than this Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel Because I want you to follow these videos exactly Like I will put a video and you get a notification So if you want to follow this course completely Ideally you should subscribe With that said, our vs code has been downloaded I have opened my vs code Don't be afraid of this, beginners And I am saying this again If you already know things We are taking a beginner friendly start in the initial videos But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos So stay tuned I will also request you to tell me in the comment section What is your level Are you a beginner, advanced or intermediate user Tell me in the comment section What is your level of web development Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please comment Now let's understand why we have downloaded vs code So if you are a beginner and you don't know what vs code is Let me tell you that vs code is a code editor Which helps you in editing code Now you might be thinking that I can edit code in notepad So yes, you can do it in notepad It will be done in notepad I am not saying it sarcastically Let's set it up and see what is there Which makes it different from notepad Let's set it up quickly I won't browse color themes Infact, I will do it I will put my dark modern theme And I have done all this Next section After this, next section You can close welcome But again, here I am telling you some tips That's it Here your vs code has started This is the vs code screen You can create a new file or folder But I will recommend you to close it Yes, close it Why have you closed it I am going to create a new folder And I am going to name it You guessed it right Sigma web development course And we will do everything in this course We will do everything We will do everything related to course We won't do much You can press shift and right click If you have windows app You can see here Open with code option This open with code option Helps you to open this particular folder In vs code You will select it You will say yes I trust this file Click on it and say yes I trust the authors And this folder has opened If I click on plus to create a new file Suppose I have written index.html Write it If you don't know what I am writing Enter it And then I will write Hey I am Your first HTML file Suppose I have written this You can see this dot It means you haven't saved this file Please save it If you hit control S, it will be saved You can also enable auto save option As you type You won't see this dot Your files will be saved instantly As you type I recommend this We won't use control S If you want to save it You can disable this option One more thing I want you to do Click on gear and settings And search mouse Now you can see editor Check it And then close settings Now you don't have to worry About VS code Why it is there You don't have to check all these Now you can simply Scroll And your font size Will change Now I will show you a magic It's very simple In downloads In sigma web development course This file was created Which is very natural Because I have opened this folder in VS code So this file is also created In this folder I will create another file I will create this dot TXT And type this is this So this file will be created here So this folder and VS code Are running in sync If I open this file from notepad And I show you That I can do that too But I won't use notepad Because VS code has some things Which notepad doesn't give me And I want to get those features I don't want to overrun you But I will show you What is there in VS code Which you don't get in notepad If I type here Let's say HTML If I type here If I type here It gives me a boilerplate template If I click here It will show up here We will discuss about this later Don't get overwhelmed by this But I want to tell you How this VS code is useful Why we didn't use notepad And why we used VS code And we get this feel Like developer feel, hacker feel That feel is also important That's why we get confidence to do coding Now I want to comment for Mac and Linux users Exactly similar things I am using windows I can't use all three laptops But I can't use mac and windows together So, exactly same things Will be there for you In fact, I want to say Things will be similar You can follow along easily So don't get tensed I will tell you about some extensions In a while You will enjoy using those extensions And you will also say What a great thing you recommended But I will tell you in a while I am telling you that you will enjoy I want to tell you before that You will right click on command palette And here you will see Many options of VS code You don't need to know all these options As we will move forward in the course All the features That will be used I will tell you about them And you can use them But now I will toggle a screencast mode You don't have to do this But I will do it I will click on it And I will type anything If I press caps lock It will show you when I pressed which button This is not irrelevant for you But I want to tell you That the screencast mode We can change The settings of the screencast mode Here you can see The vertical offset of the screencast mode What does it mean? If I make it 0 It will come up And if I make it 60 It will come up If I make it 80 It will come up From bottom It will show up So I made it 0 Now I will type anything If I do this It will show up So I will close this file And close the settings tab These are tabs You have exactly the same tabs in Chrome You must have known what this is You will forget about this I will tell you step by step What exactly is what You can also close the welcome page By any chance if you want to zoom in I will do it because I am recording a video You can add Ctrl plus numpad plus I have shown you below I am zooming in Because I am recording videos So ideally I want you to see the screen from close But when I am coding I don't zoom in that much So these are related to VS code I want to tell you How websites work A website basically Works by 3 types of people Imagine 3 people One is client brother, one is server brother Who is client brother Who is server brother Who is browser brother Who is also called Babu brother Browser brother So browser brother, client brother, server brother What is client, server, browser What is browser, I am client You, all of us Who use a browser Who is browser, this is chrome Hello Chrome, I am client I will tell client when I write code with harry.com Suppose I write code with harry.com So basically what I say I say With this browser Please give me code with harry.com website Or if I write here youtube.com I say give me youtube.com website I say browser brother Give me youtube.com I want to see youtube Browser says you want youtube Take this So here I will enter youtube.com So from server youtube.com Do you understand From server youtube.com It has shown me this screen This work happened so fast Because my internet speed is very fast So fast It is less nowadays But still It is very fast So with this fast internet speed All these things are getting very fast So client sends a request to server Through browser Browser is client's, means my assistant Whatever I say with browser, it will help me To bring this web page from server Who is managing server Server is managing youtube Managing youtube.com server And in that server There is a code which sends me This type of code So when I write youtube.com This code came Now how to convert this code This is browser's work So client says Give me youtube.com Browser says you want youtube.com Wait I will ask youtube.com Then browser goes to server Means it requests server It says give me youtube.com So server will give it to him Here it will say no Here it will say error Here it will say server error Whatever response should be 200 Response code is 200 With that response Our browser Comes back to client and shows this kind of page I hope this is clear to you Client, browser, server So client goes to browser Browser goes to server So this is how this works This is very important When you write google.com So client asks you to give me google.com Browser says Gurudev, you want google.com Wait I will get it from server So server goes to browser Browsers bring google.com And gives it to you Now along with google.com Server sends all images Videos, whatever things are there Like this icons These icons' url is also written in this code And that also works as browser To display it properly So server sends a bundle to browser Like this bundle And passing this bundle Like this is the work of browser Now further whatever interaction user will do With this page, browser will ask Additional request If I right click and inspect And then go to network And here I write Harry So many requests have been sent For images and many more So as you interact You will have to send more requests To browser So in total you can think of it as a restaurant You gave an order As you gave an order A waiter took your order And then he went to kitchen He sent your order to kitchen And then finally When kitchen gave the order So what did this waiter do Which is working as browser That waiter saw your order It is possible that the order Can't be made in kitchen It is rare that you don't get But it happens sometimes Here also sometimes You get to see error Like 404 error or 500 error Server is not working So whenever you see such errors You get to know But ideally 200 means ok And you get this kind of web page So you can think of it as a restaurant So whenever you write google.com slash mail It will show you And if you write codewithari.com slash contact It will show you Codewithari.com slash contact If it is not available then it will show 404 Or if there is a 500 error It will show you a page with 500 error So this cycle keeps going Client sent the request Browser sent the server Server processed the request Then server sent the browser Data back And whatever data it sent, browser showed it to client Browser sent the server the same request Then server sent something Whatever data server sent It came back to client And so on So now you will think that this is ok But what is back-end Back-end is how server is processing the request Now if you have a blog There is a lot of data in the blog So what you will do You will store every web page of the blog separately Or you will dynamically generate that content You will dynamically generate that content I will take google example If I search for Harry by You can see that Google header These links This format doesn't change If I write here Shubham So as soon as I write Shubham You see that when I wrote Harry by It's content is showing me similar So what Google does Google's server Back-end processes the data And it's used to send This kind of HTML For corresponding query So when I write Shubham It sends this So the process of generating this Is happening through the back-end Now this back-end can be Django This back-end can be Flask This back-end can be Node.js This back-end can be PHP This back-end can be Ruby on Rails And the database used in back-end Is used This is front-end code Which is sent by server And how server made this code We don't know because it's running on server If you are confused then don't be You will understand We will see back-end in future Now we understand how front-end works Front-end is primarily Made with 3 languages HTML, CSS And JavaScript These are 3 languages which are needed If you are making a website Then you need HTML, CSS, JavaScript In most of the cases If you use HTML only Then it becomes a basic skeleton of the website After that when you use CSS You can style it Like this button looks like this So it's only because of CSS Along with that this button looks red Or this button looks curvy This is all because of CSS This edge here This is all because of CSS Which button should be used What color should be used What will be done by hover All these things are done by CSS In a way, CSS is a beauty of HTML HTML is the existence of any page This is a standard Which is agreed If you make a website then you will make it on HTML So that browser makers can understand How to parse it Browser's job is to parse HTML And HTML is a skeleton This is a standard So if you make a website in the world It will be made on HTML This is a standard This is a standard so that Everyone can make the same kind of pages And if someone is making a browser Then they have to parse the same language If as a beginner you have learned 80% HTML Then you are good to go for web development Now some things happen directly from HTML Like if I write a quick HTML code And show you Then I am writing HTML code like this I have used the exclamation mark Don't worry about the code I have written I will write And I can open this HTML file Like this And as soon as I open this HTML file You can see It will open like this I can open it directly By double clicking And it opened But it is not styled This HTML file is very basic Now you can run videos directly from HTML I have an HTML file Which I will show you I will change this HTML file And show you So that we can show you videos HTML has a video tag If we enter the video Then the video will play Like if I enter video1.mp4 Then the VS Code will show me Video1.mp4 This is the benefit of VS Code So if I reload it Then the video will be automatically seen I can play it I have to write controls And I will refresh it So I can play it This is a very expensive game And the seller needs a lot of money He needs cash He is asking for 130 crores Final Now if I enter Video2.mp4 I have entered video1 I have two more videos I have some more videos And after this If I enter video2.mp4 Then video2 will be seen I will reload it So I have entered Ben Stokes And I will show you With my own hands What is this? This is the lookalike of Ben Stokes If I enter video3 Then my third video will be shown I will reload it And you can see I can play it So this is our third video I have entered video3.mp4 So I will close it And we can also play video4 And video4 Is a DJ video In which DJ plays So you can make such things By using only HTML You don't need to do anything else You can play videos And display images All this can be done by using HTML Now if you want to style it Suppose I want to have a border Or a red background Then what I have to do for that I have to use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website Then comes JavaScript Which adds interaction To a website For example, what will happen when I click on search What will happen when I write code with harry Like code with harry And here comes autocomplete Why did this come? Because a request went to the server And for this query The autocomplete results came So all these things are done with JavaScript This is called Client-side scripting If we want to do scripting or coding In the client side Then we can do it With the help of JavaScript So our website is called Beauty with brain I am talking about the website Beauty with brain CSS adds beauty And brain comes from JavaScript JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic Like if you want to change the content Then all this is done with JavaScript Here are a lot of mosquitoes So I will kill them Oh no, they are not getting anything from here My racket is working Oh my god So please subscribe because I eat current snacks for you So when I was in college I was told that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript one by one First learn 100% HTML Then learn 100% CSS Until you don't remember all the properties Then learn JavaScript But this is a wrong idea Why is it wrong? Because you only learn 80% HTML And only 40-60% CSS And JavaScript You can learn only 50-70% And start web development And make projects You can move forward In this course I will tell you about chat GPT And the impact of chat GPT on web development So we will talk about this So don't ever run after perfection About HTML and CSS Don't think that you will do HTML for one year Then CSS for the next year Then JavaScript for the third year Then you will make projects in the fourth year Don't think like this Do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% You can make a great website And as you make the website Your experience will teach you more HTML CSS and JavaScript And you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript While you are making money And working as a professional web developer So you will be earning along with learning And also Moving your skills forward So don't think that you will make a website Only when you remember all HTML tags Only when you remember all CSS properties And you will learn all JavaScript That's all I will teach you That matters We are going to learn what matters And I don't want you to learn for years So I designed this course in this way So that you can learn only what matters And you can learn the rest from practice And I will teach you a lot in this course Here we have some mosquitoes To learn the sigma web development course Which is good, our audience is increasing In this course we will learn HTML, CSS Then JavaScript In this course I will teach you some tricks Which you might have not heard before And I have learned those tricks in different points of my career I will tell you in this course I have learned some amazing tricks In my career very late And I want you to learn them As soon as you start Now if you have any doubt in this course In the upcoming videos You can use the hashtag doubt And ask your doubts I will try to answer all the doubts I will try my best to solve your doubts So if you have any technical questions You can use the hashtag doubt And please don't use the hashtag doubt In your questions or comments And write without using the hashtag doubt So that I can prioritize The comments with the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will get to learn everything in this course So like this course If you haven't done it yet That will bring a smile on my face Now what is this React, next.js What is Angular So all these front-end frameworks Help you to use JavaScript better Meaning HTML, CSS, JavaScript Help you to make the website faster How? We will learn this in this course Yes, we will learn in this course I told you that I will make this course In a different way I will make you from zero To hero in web development And tie your chair Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express I want to give you a good analogy To teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript HTML is just like a car skeleton After that, you paint CSS And if you put an internal engine in the car Then it becomes JavaScript For example, a human The skeleton is HTML After that, if you put a skin Then it becomes CSS And if you put a brain, then it becomes JavaScript Now I will take you to Forbes.com As soon as you go to Forbes There is a website And Forbes.com Is a website that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript Just like any other website Now if I right click And click on inspect Then this inspect element is opened Now here you can see They have used the script in the head And to add CSS They have used the link So what I will do here I will remove their CSS So to remove CSS I will clear all their style tags And use delete key So as soon as I remove all these style tags And also remove all these link tags So as soon as I Delete all their style sheets See what happened to this page This page looks like this They only have raw HTML What size of images should be there They have forgotten all this And only raw HTML is written here Which has not been styled at all So the condition of Forbes.com is like this So without CSS They are showing only raw buttons Raw text, raw links And similarly I can see without JavaScript How this website will look like Now if I delete HTML Tag of this page Like this I have deleted all this So this is a blank page So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript In making a web page I want to tell you one thing This course is officially made to be paid But I changed my mood and converted it into a free course And I thought I will put it on YouTube So I want you all to be serious Many people reached out to me To launch this course as a paid course But I was feeling that this course should be kept free Because when I was learning web development I can understand When you don't have a course to learn And you don't have the affordability To buy a paid course So I can understand And I decided to launch this sigma web development course This course is free But according to this free plan As soon as you come here You will earn crores of rupees You will give me tea, coffee, parties and all This is our agreement in this video So when you start earning crores And after this course Send me a green card or a red card But you have to do this only after you start earning good So keeping you aside In the next video I will tell you how you can earn money After completing this course I will also give you a green card Because this is also important How you can earn money That's also important How I do freelancing How clients come I will tell you everything in this course I want to tell you some action items First action item is To access this course playlist Everyone bookmark that playlist Press the star button here And save it Many of you said that We will buy it even after completing this course Thank you so much for all the support And all the love and trust you show me It encourages me to do more But this course is going to be free Now there should be no technical issues I am putting these videos in above resolution Than 1080p So you should see it clearly But many people say that Video is in SD, 240p, 144p You guys watch Bali's Wadhu You finish your mobile's internet From morning to evening You guys should call a local So I hope you understood What is the request in this video What is the response How all these websites work We got a basic idea How client-server interaction works In the coming videos We will see how the website is made We are going to make our first website In the next video So you should be very excited Because our first website is going to be made in the next video And some of you may be the first To access the playlist Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time"
