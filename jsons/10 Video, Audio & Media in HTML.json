    "text": " In today's video we will learn how to use audio, video and media elements in html In our very first video we saw that we can embed videos in html Today I will tell you how to play the video How to keep the video muted And how to enable and disable the video controls Along with that we will see about audio closely How to show media in a page So do like this video and stay tuned Because the examples I have used for video tags are very interesting Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 And I will not waste your time by opening the code by right clicking on shift and opening open with code Infact I will make it in index.html And the topic of today's video is video How to play video in html How to insert video, audio and media in html So adding video is very easy I will copy this video tag It has an src attribute And there are some other attributes of this tag But first I want to tell you Video src is equal to video.mp4 So if you have video.mp4 then it will play So let's see I have added the video control And I will preview it And you can see that the video is ready Now this is a very big video So I can give its width So I can say that the width is equal to 555 pixels And as soon as I do 555 pixels Infact I don't need to write px I will just do 555 pixels As soon as we don't need to write px in the image So as soon as I do width equal to 555 I will do a thing I will do height equal to 555 So that it becomes smaller Infact I will make it smaller And you can see it is here Now I will play it I have a good video from America What's your name? Gopendra Jogi Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US What's your name? Gopendra Jogi So you can play video like this Now there are some attributes of video tag It is very simple to use You should have a video You have given the path of the video And you have given the controls So you will get the controls You can download it You can do full screen You can mute it You can do picture in picture All this is provided by your browser But I will tell you about some attributes First attribute is src So you must be knowing Put the video here The name of the video file is src This video file can also come from external url If I have uploaded a video on Amazon s3 I can also put the url of that video It is not necessary The video file can be on your computer It can also be on your server It can also come from third party Now what are the controls? Adds video controls like Play, pause and volume Which we have seen in the video That you are getting controls Now the browser automatically sees What are the controls What will not be in your video Then see what will auto play It will automatically play As soon as the page is loaded So if I put auto play here Let's say I put auto play here Let's say auto play See here, you have market roads How are you doing So see here So you can see that this auto play is done So I will remove auto play from here And the next attribute is loop Means once our video is played Then it will loop As I show you See here, you have market roads So this has started again Once I have finished this So it has started again So this loop works like this The next attribute is muted Muted mute the video So if I write here Muted Sometimes we want the video to be muted In fact, when I add videos here On codewithdhari.com And I demonstrate something Like downloading VS code Then I use muted attribute Because I don't want When I record a video If there is background noise It should be heard For example, I want to show you That this is the element So I will scroll down And make a video And highlight it So I don't want audio So I mute it So you can use muted attribute Then poster Poster is very important So I have an image here Download.jpg If I write here Poster is equal to And I write download.jpg So you will see something like this It looks like this If I play the poster Then the video will play So in a way thumbnail YouTube thumbnail It looks exactly like this This is the poster attribute So you can use all these attributes Width and height You know that It specifies the dimension of the video Like I have shown you Width and height Both the items Width and height You have seen So I hope You have understood this Now After this The thing I want to tell you Is audio So this is for all the video attributes It is very straightforward I want you to make a website Which I will give you At the end of this video In a quick quiz So do listen to the quick quiz In fact, I will put the heading Quick quiz So that I don't forget I will give it to you now And it will be a very interesting quiz And everyone should solve it But It is more difficult To solve it So I will give it to you But Before that As you write audio Here comes the SRC And I have to put it in Sachin.mp3 So as I put it in Sachin.mp3 Now see here I will reload it And here the audio did not come Which is strange Let's see what the problem is here I will not put src is equal to I will have to write controls here So if I don't write controls I won't see the audio See now the audio has come I can see the controls here I can also set the volume I play this audio Sachin what is Sachin? Don't ask Sachin Don't ask Sachin Ok So this is our audio If I mute it It won't work I can also move it forward Don't ask Sachin Ok You have seen So this is the audio of Sachin.mp3 Now what we will do That We will see some attributes of this audio SRC you know that Source video file Ok Then after that controls You know that play pause of volume Which we just saw What will auto play do It will automatically play If I have here What is Sachin Sachin Automatically play Don't ask Sachin So what is auto play It will automatically play our audio After this Next attribute is loop What will loop do It will repeat it If I want to loop it So I have auto play And I will loop it Sachin what is Sachin Don't ask Sachin Once Sachin what is Sachin Second time Don't ask Sachin So you have seen it has repeated Means once it was saved Then after that it was saved again Because I was looping the audio Ok So you have seen this Sachin.mp3 I looped it Means once it was saved Then it was saved again Then it was saved again Ok Sachin what is Sachin Ok it was saying it again and again Because this mp3 It will play again and again So there are many use cases Of this When you want this mp3 To repeat Ok So if you want your mp3 to repeat Then you can use it Now after this What will mutate do It will mute the audio And definitely you don't want By default your audio To be mute in most of the cases But Sometimes we want That The audio is muted And we can tell the user That listen to this And mute it Sachin what is it We do this with multiple audio You want to show 5-6 audio together You can mute them The user can play and Mute it and see Ok So you have control in your hand You can use this if you want Ok So this is the whole thing So I hope you understood this You will have fun Now preload The most confusing Attribute That's why I have explained it On codewithdhari.com That Preload attribute Can have these values First value can be none This is the default value It indicates that the browser Should not preload the audio at all Ok Preload means If you want the browser To fetch the data Then you will use the preload attribute Otherwise you won't use the preload attribute Ok Preload is equal to none Default value Preload is equal to metadata Means the browser will only Preload the information About the audio file That is the metadata Preload will preload it It will preload it from the beginning And by doing auto The browser will preload the entire audio Ok So preload is equal to auto If I do it It will download And automatically load So that whenever the user plays it The audio will be saved Ok So This is the preload attribute And in interviews A lot of people ask about this Preload attribute So you should know What is this preload attribute Before moving forward I want you to share this playlist With your friends Because I see that Interest is declining As we are moving forward in the videos I request you to like this video And along with that As you are Forging this repository You should also star it Ok Your star, likes They will help me a lot In bringing these kind of preloads So this was about audio and video tags Ok I have told you all the attributes And you should definitely use this I will give you all the images So that you can try out this thing A lot of people were asking Can we use replete In this course I have not used replete But replete.com is an amazing website If you want to use it in your phone If you want to run HTML There is a replete app for iOS And Android So you can try it out A lot of people are asking How to record in your phone Replate But what I want to say is That most of the people Want to use VS code Prefer it So I thought Why should I make videos in VS code But I personally use replete I use replete a lot In fact videos are also available in replete The next topic is SVG Related to Media SVG is a format In which you can create High graphics vector images So you can basically copy Circles and such SVG is used in the same way As our IMG tag is used So if I put SVG here SVG will come here So you can see the circle and SVG Here it is Video, audio, SVG These are inline elements That's why we can see them in one line You can see it here Now what is here You can save the SVG file separately You can save the SVG file separately Like if I write here Img.svg And save the SVG content So if I write it as IMG And write it as IMG.svg So you can see here That I didn't get to see this image If I write here And write my SVG image So you can see here That my SVG image came like this But I didn't get to see SVG Why did this happen? Because SVG I write SVG file in browser And whenever you want to see SVG file In the browser You can put a declaration I'll show you So I wrote here SVG file not showing So here is an answer Here is an answer of stack overflow Which will tell you So you have to write this I'll show you You have to add this This is called namespace declaration So you have to add this SVG And now you can see SVG This is very important And whenever you make websites in the future You will get stuck in this problem I get stuck So I'm telling you The problem you will get stuck in You didn't get the problem I told you the problem and the solution Next topic is iframes Iframes is a very simple thing You can embed another website In your website Like if I want to embed this webpage I can use iframes So see This is mandli's iframe And I'll copy this url And paste it here And you can see here That the website is embedded So you definitely want to embed this in a big iframe But if you want it to be embedded You can do it like this I'll increase the height of this Width is equal to width Let's say I write 122 Height is equal to 444 Let's say So see it came like this Now definitely this width Came in this line But if I increase the width Let's say I increase width to 322 So see this My website is embedded So you can embed a website Another use case of iframes is YouTube video If you want to share a youtube video And click on embed It will give you iframe code And you can start it here If you want to start at a particular time You can do that The point at which you start and share That time comes here Let's say I want to start from here Let's say video starts from here So I'll click on share After that I'll click on embed I'll start at 1219 And I'll copy it And I'll put it in my code I'll comment out this iframe And I'll put the iframe below I'll word wrap it So you can see the code properly So now what I'll do After pasting this I'll show you the document This video is embedded So I hope you understood something And that's all in media HTML You'll get to see many things in miscellaneous topics But that's all about media Audio, video, media in HTML This is what you'll use 95% of the time Now I'll give you a quick quiz And your quiz is Create a website Which shows videos of different categories And audios of different categories You can use YouTube videos in an iframe Using YouTube's embedding feature So what you have to do You have to create a website Which will give you a lot of content Now you can use video audio tags And YouTube's share feature The way I embedded this YouTube video You can embed it the same way And make a great website And show it to me You can comment on GitHub And you can also explain the code But do try this quiz And do write sigma batch op in the comment section Do access this playlist And like the video Do write sigma batch op That's all for now Thank you so much for watching this video And I'll see you next time Bye"
